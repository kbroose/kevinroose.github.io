      <p>
        I'm a technology columnist at <em>The New York Times</em>, where I've spent the past decade covering Silicon Valley, social media, and the societal effects of new technology. I co-host <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/column/hard-fork">Hard Fork</a>, a weekly podcast about tech, and previously created <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/column/rabbit-hole">Rabbit Hole</a>, an investigative series about internet radicalization. I've written three books—including <em>Futureproof</em>, about AI and automation—and am currently working on a fourth, about the race to build artificial general intelligence. Before the <em>Times</em>, I was a writer at <em>New York</em> magazine. I live in the Bay Area.

      <h2>Source FAQ</h2>
      <p class="faq-intro">For journalists, sources, and anyone who wants to get in touch about a story.</p>

      <details>
        <summary>How do I contact you securely?</summary>
        <p>If your tip isn't particularly sensitive, use the contact form above. For sensitive information, reach me on Signal: <strong>@kevinroose.01</strong>. You can also use <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/tips">The New York Times's confidential tip process</a>.</p>
      </details>

      <details>
        <summary>What does "on the record" mean?</summary>
        <p><strong>On the record:</strong> I may publish anything you tell or show me, attributed to you by name and/or title.<br>
        <strong>On background:</strong> I may quote or paraphrase what you tell me, but won't attribute it to you by name.<br>
        <strong>Off the record:</strong> What you tell me can serve as general context, but I won't publish it or quote you.</p>
        <p>Unless we agree otherwise in advance, assume our conversation is on the record.</p>
      </details>

      <details>
        <summary>Can I approve my quotes?</summary>
        <p>No. It's <em>Times</em> policy not to allow quote approval. I record interviews with consent and have conducted thousands without having to correct quotes afterward.</p>
      </details>

      <details>
        <summary>Do you pay for interviews?</summary>
        <p>No. It's against <em>New York Times</em> ethics rules.</p>
      </details>

      <details>
        <summary>What stories are you looking for?</summary>
        <p>I cover technology and its impact on society, with a current focus on AI. I prefer stories based on primary sources—documents, screenshots, on-the-record interviews—rather than product announcements or personnel moves.</p>
      </details>

      <details>
        <summary>What if you get something wrong?</summary>
        <p>The <em>Times</em> has a transparent corrections policy. If I make a factual error, I fix it and publish a correction.</p>
